[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@walrussuit%2Fmake-husky-ts.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@walrussuit/make-husky-ts)<br/><br/>
I got tired of repeatedly setting up a TS project with prettier / husky, so I made a CLI to do it automatically.

## Usage

```sh
npx @walrussuit/make-husky-ts <PROJECT_NAME>
```

## Help

```sh
npx @walrussuit/make-husky-ts --help
```
